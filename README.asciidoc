== 97 Things Every Agile Developer Should Know

Welcome to _97 Things Every Agile Developer Should Know_, pearls of wisdom for programmers collected from leading Agile practitioners.  There is no overarching narrative: The collection is intended simply to contain multiple and varied perspectives on what it is that contributors to the project feel programmers should know. This can be anything from code-focused advice to culture, from algorithm usage to agile thinking, from implementation know-how to professionalism, from style to substance, etc. _For Guidelines, please see Contributors_Guidelines located in the repository._

=== How to Contribute

If you're new to git and GitHub and just want to keep things as simple as possible, this tutorial will give you a quick and easy way to make your contribution.  _If you already have an account, please skip ahead to_ *Copy ("fork") the project repository to your account.* Here are the steps you'll need to follow:

==== Creating a GitHub account

To create and edit a page or to comment on an existing page, you will need to create an account on GitHub. If you don't have one already, then go to the https://github.com/signup/free[GitHub Signup page]. It's free.

GitHub has excellent tools for collaborating and workflow management, and will be the primary way we communicate with you over the course of the project.

==== Copy ("fork") the project repository to your account 

Once you've got an account or if you already have one, fork (GitHub lingo for copying) the main project to your account.  To do this, go to the  https://github.com/oreillymedia/97-things-every-agile-developer-should-know/[97 Things Every Agile Developer Should Know] repository on GitHub and click the "Fork" button at the upper right hand side of the screen.

==== Edit your file using AsciiDoc

Once you've got the file created in your account, you can start editing it at your leisure.  Remember to:

* Mark up your text using http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[AsciiDoc], which is similar to Markdown and other basic wiki-like markup formats. Please see link for more information on Asciidoc.
* Change the line wrapping from "No Wrap" to "Soft Wrap."  Otherwise, all your text will appear on a single line.

To add your chapter, you'll need to create a new file in GitHub.
To do this, click the + button next to the directory name to create a new file 
Locate the small \+ sign next to the repository name.  (A tooltip will appear that says "Create a new file here" when you hover your mouse above it.)  Click the "\+" button:

In the new screen, you'll need to: 

* Enter a name for the file.  Name the file according to the general topic area, and be sure to include the extension ".asciidoc" at the end.  For example, "foo_and_bar.asciidoc".
* Enter the chapter title in the editing box; it should be prefaced with two "==" signs.  For example, "== Always Foo the Bar"
* Once you've entered the filename and title, the "Commit Changes" button at the bottom of the screen will activate.  Click the button to save your file. 

You will see something like this:
